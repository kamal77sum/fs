In 1926, Bosch started to produce windshield wipers, and in 1927,
 injection pumps for diesel. Bosch bought the gas appliances 
production from Junkers & Co. in 1932. In the same year, the company 
developed its first power drill and presented its first car radio.

As early as the end of 1933, negotiations between Robert Bosch
 AG and the National Socialists began on
 relocating parts of armaments production to the 
interior of Germany. Bosch founded two such alternative plants in 1935 and 1937: 
Dreilinden Maschinenbau GmbH in Kleinmachnow near Berlin and Elektro- und Feinmechanische 
Industrie GmbH (later Trillke-Werke GmbH) in Hildesheim. Both plants were used exclusively 
for armaments production. These "shadow factories" were built under great secrecy and in
 close cooperation with the Nazi authorities. In 1937, Bosch AG became a limited liability company (GmbH).

The Bosch subsidiary Dreilinden Maschinenbau 
GmbH (DLMG) in Kleinmachnow near Berlin employed 
around 5,000 people, more than half of whom were forced laborers, prisoners of war,'
 and female concentration camp prisoners, including many women from the Warsaw Uprising.
 They had to produce accessories for German Luftwaffe aircraft. In Hildesheim, a secret plant for the entire electrical equipment of tanks, tractors, and trucks of the Wehrmacht was built. In 1944, 4,290 men and women worked in the Trillke factory, 2,019 of whom were forced laborers, prisoners of war and military internees. During the Second World War, a total of 2,711 people who had been deported to Germany from the occupied countries had to work at the Bosch plant in Hildesheim.

In the last years of the war, no new German tank ever drove without the starter elements from the Bosch factory in Hildesheim. Bosch also had a monopoly position in the outfitting of German Luftwaffe aircraft.
